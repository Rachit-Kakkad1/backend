INSURANCE COVERAGE POLICY

Jurisdiction: California  
Effective Date: 2024-01-01  
Document Type: Policy

SECTION 1: WATER DAMAGE CLAIMS

Water damage claims for residential properties located in the State of California must be assessed based on the cause, duration, and discoverability of the damage.

Coverage is provided for sudden and accidental water discharge, including but not limited to burst pipes, appliance failures, or plumbing system malfunctions, provided that the insured takes reasonable steps to mitigate further loss once the damage is discovered.

Gradual water damage resulting from long-term seepage, continuous leakage, or deferred maintenance is excluded from coverage unless explicitly endorsed under a separate rider. Adjusters must review maintenance records and inspection reports when determining eligibility.

Claims involving water intrusion caused by surface flooding, rising groundwater, or overflow of natural bodies of water are excluded unless the policyholder maintains a valid flood insurance endorsement in force at the time of loss.

SECTION 2: FIRE LOSS CLAIMS

Fire loss claims are covered when damage results from unintended ignition events, including electrical faults, cooking incidents, or external wildfire exposure, subject to policy limits and deductibles.

For properties located in designated wildfire-prone regions, insurers must comply with California wildfire risk regulations, including mandatory coverage continuation and claims handling timelines.

All fire loss claims require the following documentation:
- Official fire department incident report
- Proof of ownership or insurable interest
- Itemized inventory of damaged property
- Assessment of additional living expenses when displacement occurs

Intentional acts, fraud, or material misrepresentation by the insured void coverage.

SECTION 3: CLAIM HANDLING PROCEDURES

Upon receipt of a claim notification, the insurer must acknowledge the claim within fifteen (15) calendar days. An adjuster must be assigned and an initial investigation commenced without unreasonable delay.

Failure to comply with statutory claims handling timelines may result in regulatory penalties.

SECTION 4: EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS

This policy does not provide coverage for losses arising from:
- Wear and tear
- Gradual deterioration
- Mold resulting from excluded water events
- Negligence or failure to perform reasonable maintenance

All coverage determinations must be supported by documented evidence and policy citations.
